# ReguFlow – KYC & AML Compliance Automation

ReguFlow is a zero-code compliance automation platform that helps fintechs and regulated businesses streamline **KYC onboarding**, **AML checks**, and **risk decisioning** — without relying on opaque black-box systems.

This project was built as a **hackathon prototype** to demonstrate how compliance workflows can be faster, explainable, and regulator-friendly.

## 🚀 What Problem Are We Solving?

Modern fintech teams struggle with:
- Slow and manual KYC reviews
- Fragmented vendors (ID checks, PEP lists, sanctions, fraud tools)
- Poor audit trails that regulators don’t trust
- Rigid compliance systems that engineering teams hate to maintain

**ReguFlow** sits between your product and your compliance vendors, automating decisions while keeping humans in control.
